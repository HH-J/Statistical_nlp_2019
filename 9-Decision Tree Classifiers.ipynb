Additionally, there are two adjacent small lung nodules in the left\\n     lobe laterally abutting with one of them abutting the pleural surface\\n     measuring up to 7 mm in diameter.  One of these contains a band like area of\\n     calcium.  No dominant masses are evident.\\n     \\n     Assessment of the airways reveals some narrowing of the bronchus intermedius\\n     which occurs during an area of respiratory excursion and reflect a component\\n     of bronchomalacia.  No obstructing airway lesions are identified.  Note is\\n     made of increased opacities adjacent to the superior segment region of left\\n     lower lobe with pleural and parenchymal components and some calcification\\n     probably reflecting postoperative change.  Finally, a slightly nodular opacity\\n     is seen within a linear band like opacification at the extreme left lung base.\\n     \\n     Assessment of the skeletal structures of the thorax reveals deformities of\\n     right lateral ribs probably reflecting previous surgery.

At\\n     the time of follow up CT, thin section images of these nodules are suggested\\n     to better assess for calcium and to help distinguish between benign granulomas\\n     and foci of metastatic disease.

With this additional history in mind, the areas of consolidation and\\n     ground-glass in the right lower lobe as well as the additional areas of\\n     ground-glass opacity of the left upper could potentially be due to\\n     bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma.  As pneumonia may also produce the same\\n     appearance, comparison to older CT scans and  careful follow up after\\n     antibiotic therapy would be helpful in helping to distinguish between these\\n     entities.\\n     \\n     \\n\\n\",\n",

Non-ionic contrast was administered due to a\\n     history of coronary artery disease.  Images were acquired with 8-mm\\n     collimation and reconstructed at 8-mm intervals throughout the thorax.\\n     \\n     Assessment of the soft-tissue structures of the thorax reveals an abnormal\\n     elliptical structure in the right hemithorax which extends from the right\\n     hilum centrally to the right lung apex superiorly.  This structure is quite\\n     heterogeneous in appearance, comprised of fluid attenuation, multiple\\n     collections of air, as well as some areas of soft-tissue attenuation with\\n     branching vessels.  Of note, the right middle lobe pulmonary arteries are\\n     difficult to accurately identify at their proximal origin.  Also of note is\\n     the fact that the right middle lobe bronchus is difficult to delineate.  It is\\n     probably located on images #19 and 20 of series 5, with an unusual orientation\\n     and a narrowed caliber.  The heterogeneous elliptical structure most likely\\n     represents the right middle lobe, which is collapsed and partially necrotic.\\n     It has an unusual orientation, and given the difficulty identifying normal\\n     right middle lobe bronchi and pulmonary arteries, the possibility of a torsed\\n     lobe should be considered.\\n     \\n     The mediastinum demonstrates slight rightward shift, an expected postoperative\\n     finding.

The bronchus intermedius appears narrowed, and the\\n     proximal right lower lobe bronchus appears narrowed, but the segmental bronchi\\n     are patent and do not appear significantly narrowed, although their course is\\n     slightly altered.  Soft-tissue thickening is noted around the carina and both\\n     main stem bronchi.\\n     \\n     The heart is not enlarged.  No pericardial effusion is identified.

Nonionic IV contrast was used due to the\\n     patient's allergic history.\\n     \\n     FINDINGS: As seen on previous study of [**2838-2-12**], there is the\\n     persistent appearance of a right upper lobe cavitary lesion with marked\\n     pleural thickening and loculate hydropneumothorax, and likely a postsurgical\\n     change. At the right lower lobe posteriorly, there are some areas of\\n     improvement of previously seen patchy air-space opacity, but with other areas\\n     of slightly increased involvement seen more inferiorly. Overall, in comparison\\n     to the previous exam there is now diffusely increased ground glass and\\n     interstitial opacity throughout both lungs. A small amount of pleural fluid\\n     and thickening at the bases bilaterally, with small pleural calcifications are\\n     again noted. The heart and great vessels are stable in appearance. No\\n     pericardial effusions seen. There are no enlarged mediastinal or axillary\\n     lymph nodes. The osseous structures demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic\\n     lesions.

A small anterior pericardial effusion is noted.\\n     \\n     A feeding tube is identified with tip in the proximal jejunum.

High-attenuation\\n     material is present within the gallbladder, which likely represents\\n     cholelithiasis as reported on the recent previous ultrasound.

Allowing for this, the patient is status post sternotomy. There is\\n     extensive opacification of the left lung, involving approximately two-thirds\\n     of the lung. Lung markings in the upper third are not appreciated, likely due\\n     to respiratory motion. There is probably some mass effect with slight shift of\\n     the mediastinum to the right. On the right, no upper zone redistribution or\\n     gross effusion is seen. No consolidation. Vascular blurring likely relates to\\n     motion.\\n     \\n     IMPRESSION: Opacification of approximately two-thirds of the left lung, with\\n     mass effect. I suspect this represents pleural effusion. Underlying\\n     consolidation cannot be excluded. Poor visualization of vessels in the left\\n     lung apex is of uncertain significance, but most likely relates to blurring\\n     from respiratory motion.\\n     \\n     Compared with [**3153-11-26**], the opacification in the left lung has increased\\n     considerably.

A preprocedure timeout was performed verifying patient\\n     identity, site of procedure, and the proposed procedure, using two patient\\n     identifiers. The patient was placed supine on the CT table.  Limited non-\\n     contrast scanning showed small bilateral pleural effusions, a moderate amount\\n     of ascites throughout the upper abdomen, and NG tube within the fundus, and a\\n     Dobhoff tube with the tip past the level of the ligament of Treitz.

Using the\\n     same introducer needle, the stomach was accessed using intermittent\\n     fluoroscopic guidance.  With appropriate positioning confirmed within the\\n     stomach using CT fluoroscopy, a 0.035 Amplatz wire was advanced into and\\n     coiled within the stomach.\\n     \\n     CT-GUIDED CATHETER PLACEMENT:  With appropriate positioning within the\\n     stomach verified by CT-fluoroscopy, the tract was serially dilated to\\n     accommodate the 12 French [**Location (un) 145**]-[**Doctor Last Name 5931**] gastrostomy tube, which was advanced\\n     into the stomach without difficulty. With appropriate positioning documented\\n     within the stomach by CT fluoroscopy, the pigtail was deployed, securing the\\n     catheter. The catheter was attached to the skin using a StatLock.\\n     Approximately 60 cc of dilute water- soluble contrast material was then\\n     injected.
